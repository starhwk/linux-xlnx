Device-Tree bindings for Xilinx ZynqMP DisplayPort DMA engine

The ZynqMP DisplayPort subsystem handles DMA channel buffer management,
blending, and audio mixing. The DisplayPort subsystem receives display
and audio frames from DPDMA and transmits output to the DisplayPort IP core.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "xlnx,zynqmp-dpdma".
 - reg: Base address and size of the IP core.
 - interrupts: Interrupt number.
 - interrupts-parent: phandle for interrupt controller.
 - clocks: phandle for AXI clock
 - clock-names: The identification string, "axi_clk", is always required.
 - #dma-channels: Should be <6>.
 - #dma-cells: Should be <1> for channel ID. Please see "dmas" in "DMA client"
 section below.

Example:

	dma-controller: dma-controller@43c10000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,zynqmp-dpdma";
		reg = <0x43c10000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 54 4>;
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		clocks = <&clkc 16>;
		clock-names = "axi_clk";

		dma-channels = <6>;
		#dma-cells = <1>;
	};

* DMA client

Required properties:
- dmas: a list of <[DPDMA device phandle] [Channel ID]> pairs. "Channel ID"
  is defined as video0 = 0, video1 = 1, video2 = 2, graphics = 3, audio0 = 4,
  and audio1 = 5.

Example:

	zynqmp-display@fd4a0000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,zynqmp-dpsub-1.7";
		reg = <0x0 0xfd4a0000 0x0 0x1000>,
		      <0x0 0xfd4aa000 0x0 0x1000>,
		      <0x0 0xfd4ab000 0x0 0x1000>,
		      <0x0 0xfd4ac000 0x0 0x1000>;

		...

		dma-names = "vid0", "vid1", "vid2", "gfx0";
		dmas = <&dma-controller 0>,
		       <&dma-controller 1>,
		       <&dma-controller 2>,
		       <&dma-controller 3>;
		...
	};
